# Technologies that I want to use in this project

Just using as many different Node.js libraries / techniques as possible so I have a centralized place to reference code.

- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Redux](http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/UsageWithReact.html) for general front-end control flow
  - Could be built with some combination of [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) / [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)
- [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) for graphs and visualizations of gathered data
- Abstracted back end
  - use [Level](https://github.com/Level/levelup) in development 
  - use [Mongo](https://www.mongodb.com/) in "production" because it actually scales beyond one computer
- Search engine for data built in [Elastic Search](https://www.sitepoint.com/search-engine-node-elasticsearch/)
- API driven backend interaction so a native iOS / Android would simply be easy to develop
- Backend API calls made via [fetch](https://github.com/github/fetch)
- [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/) automatic testing suite
- Logging via [Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston)
